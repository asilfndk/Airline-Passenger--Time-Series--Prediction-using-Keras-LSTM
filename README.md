# **AIRLINE PASSENGER (TIME-SERIES) PREDICTION USING LSTM**

I'm using LSTM deep learning model for this project. The Long Short-Term Memory network, or LSTM network, is a recurrent neural network that is trained using Backpropagation through time and overcomes the vanishing gradient problem. LSTM can be used to create large recurrent networks that in turn can be used to address difficult sequence problems in machine learning and achieve state-of-the-art results. Instead of neurons, LSTM networks have memory blocks that are connected through layers.

#### **Aim of the project:**

Given the number of passengers (in units of thousands) for last two months, what is the number of passengers next month? In order to solve this problem we will build a LSTM model and train this model with our train data which is first 100 months in our dataset. After the LSTM model training finishes and learn the pattern in time series train data.
